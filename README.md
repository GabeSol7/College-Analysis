The analysis consists of two primary tasks focused on college characteristics and linear regression simulation. The respective analyses are broken down into two R scripts, each addressing a specific question from the task.

## File Structure
The ZIP file is structured as follows:
- **/data/**: This folder contains the original datasets provided for the task.
  - *Preferred Estimates of Access and Mobility Rates by College.csv*: Dataset containing college-level data on access and mobility.
  - *College Level Characteristics.csv*: Dataset containing various institutional characteristics of colleges.
  
- **R Scripts**:
  1. **Analysis-of-College-Characteristics-and-Expenditures_Question.R**: 
     - This script addresses Question 1, analyzing the relationship between instructional expenditures per student and mobility rates, while controlling for faculty salary. It includes steps for data merging, filtering, variable transformation, and regression analysis.
     - The script also generates a binned scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between instructional expenditures and mobility rates across deciles.
  
  2. **Linear-Regression-as-an-Approximation.R**: 
     - This script addresses Question 3, performing a simulation to test the performance of linear regression when \( y \) and \( x \) are not linearly related. It assesses how often the estimated \( \hat{eta} \) coefficient is flagged as significant at the 0.05 level. Additionally, the script repeats the simulation for different sample sizes and generates a plot showing how the percentage of significant results changes with the sample size.

### Requirements
- **R** version 4.0 or higher.
- Required R packages:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `stargazer`
  - `jtools`
 
### Outputs:
- **scatter_plot.png**: Binned scatter plot generated by the Question 1 script, showing the relationship between mobility rate and instructional expenditures.
- **beta_hist.png**: Histogram of the estimated \( \hat{eta} \) values generated by the Question 3 script.
- **significance_plot.png**: Plot showing the percentage of significant \( \hat{eta} \) estimates by sample size, generated by the Question 3 script.
